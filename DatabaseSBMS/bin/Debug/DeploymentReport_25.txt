     Possible data issues
       The column [dbo].[SaleInvoices].[discountRate] on table [dbo].[SaleInvoices] must be added, but the column has no
         default value and does not allow NULL values. If the table contains data, the ALTER script will not work. To avoid this
         issue you must either: add a default value to the column, mark it as allowing NULL values, or enable the generation of
         smart-defaults as a deployment option.
